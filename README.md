## About

Lab developed for teaching about a fuzzing tool called AFL. Using AFL to find interesting crashing inputs of programs, and try out some attacker techniques related to heap vulnerabilities. To be precise I taught on AFL++ a more recent forked version.<br>

In this lab I started out by walking my students through a contrived example based on a text adventure game. Then moved on to increasingly realistic programs. Mixed in are two sample programs to try heap related manipulations.

## Tools Used

- **Operating System**: Linux x86-64. Reccommended to use a machine running Ubuntu 22.04.
- **Programming Language(s)**: C
- **Tools**: American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), AFL++, objdump

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A machine running Ubuntu 22.04. The program should on most recent Linux systems, although the supported configuration is Ubuntu 22.04.
- C. The entire project was written using C programming language.
- A suitable version of AFL++ compatible with a machine running Ubuntu 22.04.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JackTschetter/Fuzzing-with-AFL-and-Heap-Attacks
   cd Fuzzing-with-AFL-and-Heap-Attacks

This repo provides a precompiled victim binary. This victim binary was compiled from the bcimgview.c source on a Linux x86-64 machine, so it should work on most recent Linux systems. I just recently was able to get the program to work, with slight modifications, on my brand new MacBook air which has an ARM based M3/Apple Silicon chip. This was A LOT of extra work, so please stick with the provided binary on Ubuntu Linux 22.04 for best results.

${\color{red}WARNING}$ This is intentionally vulnerable low level code and source code that deliberately ignores software engineering best practices. These files were created for the sole purpose of teaching a class on Designing and Developing Secure Software. The command used to compile the binaries does so in a way that intentionally disables various defense mechanisms against certain kinds of attacks. Exercise enhanced caution when downloading and using the provided code.

## Lab

### Finding the Crash in the Maze

Our first example is modeled after a text adventure game. Getting the program to crash is like a game event. You can try compiling the program normally and running it with commands on the standard input. It is simple enough that with a little bit of reading of the source code contained in maze.c students should have been able to find how to get the magic potion.<br>

Next let's see if AFL can find the potion (crash) as well. To do this we first recompile the program using afl-cc.<br>

**afl-cc -g maze.c -o maze-for-afl**

The maze that AFL needs to explore isn't really that large, but changing the input to the game randomly would still take a long time to get to the goal, because there are only a few legal commands. The most useful thing to do is to give it a dictionary of the legal commands in the game. This is like a simplified form of grammar-based fuzzing, where we just provide some useful tokens rather than a full grammar. We supplied a sample dictionary for students to use. This is available in this repository under src.<br>

Another thing AFL needs to get started is a directory of seed inputs. A bunch of good seeds are potentially another way to give AFL information about what the input format should look like. On the other hand large seeds can cause some parts of AFL to slow down, so you can potentially put a lot of work into optimal seeds. But because we're already helping with the dictionary, choosing good inputs turns out not to be as important. Let's create a minimal set with just one

## Usage

This project was created for the purposes of teaching the class Designing and Developing Secure Software at UMN Twin Cities. For teaching purposes we provided students in the course the same source code, sample images, and pre compiled binary available for download from this repo. 

The source code is deliberately buggy and does not follow software engineering best practices. In particular their were 4 vulnerabilities which were deliberately planted in the BCIMGVIEW.c source. The goal of this assignment was for students to discover, exploit and mitigate at least 3/4 of the planted vulnerabilities. 

To help with this I regularly held labs, and office hours to assist the students. The goal of this project was to teach core competencies such as code auditing, strategies to audit large code bases, and heuristics to understand program execution logic/control flow. Along with professor I also taught students in the usage of a debugger (GDB/LLVM), and a fuzzer (AFL++). Our expectation was that students would require usage of the debugger and or fuzzer to efficiently uncover the vulnerabilities.

### Disclaimer

To my knowledge this project or some close derivative is still being used for teaching. After careful consideration, and out of fairness to current, former, and future students I will not be making detailed answers to this lab public.<br>

In the case that you are not a current or propsective student in 4271W, and would like to go over the answers to this weeks lab questions, I would be more then happy to make some time on my calendar.

## Contact

Contact me anytime! Day or night. My email is jackrtschetter@gmail.com, and phone number is 612-380-1832. Texting with a short introduction is the most efficient way to get a hold of me. I will respond ASAP.<br>

I would be happy to discuss in (much) greater technical detail the C programming language, and the low level analysis of binary code.<br>

I would also be happy to instruct in the various code auditing, debugging, and fuzzing techniques in which I guided my students to efficiently uncover and attack the vulnerabilities.

## Acknowledgements

I developed and taught from this lab during my time as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant (TA) for the class Designing and Developing Secure Software at UMN Twin Cities. At that time I was the youngest person ever in the history of the University of Minnesota to teach this class. All the previous TA's were grad students. Professor Stephen McCamant was so much more then my boss/teacher. He was also my friend, life coach, research partner and mentor.<br>

To this day Stephen McCamant was the single smartest human being that I have ever had the privilege of working and learning with. He spent hours patiently guiding me, and answering all of my questions. To my own shame Professor Stephen quickly found and corrected several mistakes I had made. In doing this he was quick to disabuse me of any hubris I might have had about my own abilities. Nevertheless I would not be one quarter of the computer scientist I am today without Professor Stephen.
